# Roblox organization for MMA Fighters

# Places 

We are using multiple places to handle the development stages:
- ðŸ¥Š MMA Fighters ðŸ¥Š : this is the public place, only Seb will deploy updates onto this one
- MMA Fighters [LABS] : this is a sandbox place that can be updated at any time just to experiment internal features
- MMA Fighters [TESTING] : this is our integration place where we are co developing (Oriane, Adnan and Seb), currently it's not Rojo synced so we need to be careful on overwriting the work of others and I recommend a regular update through the Devs whatsapp to warn the others devs about our own current work
- MMA Fighters [VENUM] : this will be used by the DA only to sketch a VENUM arena, normally no script associated we will reintegrate this work later into [TESTING] 

# Test experience
To perform real integration tests we will use the dedicated private experience: https://www.roblox.com/games/110103729488462/PREVIEW-MMA-Fighters

When all the tests are done and OK, Seb will deploy [TESTING] into the public place and inform the players through the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wFjtxkqXQe) 

# Source code

- On a daily basis I will update the scripts on the repository https://github.com/champsavenue/mma-fighters to reflect the current state of MMA Fighters [TESTING]

- I will also put a tag on the version provided by Exclusible to have kind of reference

# Workflow

1. if needed experience your next feature into [LABS]
2. once ready, integrate it into [TESTING]
3. warn the other devs about potential impacted files 
4. when feature is ready: ping Champs team
5. Seb will publish the latest version into the public place
