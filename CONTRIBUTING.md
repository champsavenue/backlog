# Roblox organization for MMA Fighters

# Places 

We are using multiple places to handle the development stages:
- ðŸ¥Š MMA Fighters ðŸ¥Š : this is the public place, only Seb will deploy updates onto this one
- [MMA PREVIEW](https://www.roblox.com/games/110103729488462/PREVIEW-MMA-Fighters): this is used for real live preview test shared with the whole team
- private places : these are devs sandbox places that can be updated at any time just to experiment internal features
- MMA Fighters [TESTING] : this is our integration place where we are co developing (Oriane, Adnan and Seb), currently it's not Rojo synced so we need to be careful on overwriting the work of others and I recommend a regular update through the Devs whatsapp to warn the others devs about our own current work
- MMA Fighters [VENUM] : this will be used by Tifanie only to sketch a VENUM arena, normally no script associated we will reintegrate this work later into [TESTING] 


# Test experience
To perform real integration tests we will use the dedicated private experience: https://www.roblox.com/games/110103729488462/PREVIEW-MMA-Fighters

When all the tests are done and OK, Seb will deploy [TESTING] into the public place and inform the players through the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wFjtxkqXQe) 

# Source code

- On a daily basis I will update the scripts on the repository https://github.com/champsavenue/mma-fighters to reflect the current state of MMA Fighters [TESTING]

- Watch out this repo contains only the Lua scripts and not the game assets

- You can use this [release](https://github.com/champsavenue/mma-fighters/releases/tag/exclusible-v1.0.0) as the reference provided by Exclusible
